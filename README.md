# Clothify

This is the final project for a data science bootcamp at Le Wagon Berlin.

The project is intended as a product to help potential clothing business owners identify the perfect location for opening their store in Berlin It currently consists of 2 parts: an exploratory part and a business analysis part.

## Exploratory part
Based on the user's neighborhood (or whole Berlin) and shop type choice, the product provides different information. Initially, it provides the amount of stores that sell that category in the chosen neighborhood, alongside with a heatmap that shows the distribution of them in the neighborhood or in the whole Berlin. The heatmap can be changed to a pin-map, which lists the above stores and provides information such as: name of the store, rating and other categories that this store sells. Additionally, the user is provided with 2 bar charts that show the mean rating (for the period 2019 - 2022) and the price level of all the shops of the chosen category per district. The amount of shops based on which  that mean rating was calculated is provided. When the user inputs only a certain neighborhood and all types of shops, the barchart provided alongside the already mentioned maps, shows the mean rating (for the period 2019 - 2022) of the choses category per district, and the amount of shops based on which this rating was calculated.

## Gap Analysis part

Based on the user's chosen shop category, the product provides a proposal of the  10 top neighbourhoods of Berlin to open a store of the chosen category. This result is provided in 2 formats: a list and a map of Berlin with coloured the proposed neighbourhoods.
